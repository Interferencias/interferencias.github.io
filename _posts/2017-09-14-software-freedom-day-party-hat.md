This Saturday (September 16th) is Software Freedom Day, and for this special day I created a [repo](https://github.com/terceranexus6/GorritoSoftwareFreedomDay) with a surprise, a printable pdf party hat. This is the image of the party hat:

The repo also includes in **Spanish** a very brief introduction to what is Software Freedom Day, what is GNU and what is GNU/Linux. Enjoy yourselves!
